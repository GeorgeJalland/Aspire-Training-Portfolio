# Guess The Number (Bulls and Cows)
This project came 8 weeks into the java training program. It is a guess the number game that takes HTTP requests and displays results in the form of JSON packages. It is an example of a Spring Boost REST api that connects to a database using JDBC-Template. This came before we learnt JPA. It demonstrates the following java concepts:
-Designing a 3rd normal form relational database
-Spring Boot framework
-Annotation based dependency injection
-Controller advice exception handling
-RESTful api
-JDBC Template
